Before the competition, become familiar with `starter_code.py`
This file (starter_code.py) outlines basic structures for problems and defines some key utilities that may be used
  in every problem. Ensure every participant is familiar with the utilities at the least, the coder should be most familiar


The strategy is as follows:
  1. Python is recommended over Java 100%
  2. Whoever is the most familiar with SYNTAX of the language and standard library should be the one writing the code
  3. The other two members will focus only on problems, and when needed help the coder
  4. Each team member will be given a set of problems, ~1-10 for the least experienced,
	~8-18 for the next most experienced, and ~16-24 for the most experienced.
	Each member should be focusing on the problems they can best handle, and if needed,
	visualize the problems together or draw pictures for comprehension.
  5. At any given moment, the coder will either be coding a problem or finding a solution.
  6. While the coder is coding, the other two members will be writing PSEUDOCODE for a problem.
	This pseudocode does NOT need to be like the language used, let the master of SYNTAX interpret the pseudocode
	Just make sure the flow of the pseudocode works
  7. When the coder needs help, he/she may ask the one who wrote the pseudocode
	The coder does not always need to know what is happening with the code
  8. When the pseudocoders need help, they should ask each other
  9. Once the programmer has caught up with the problems that have been solved by the pseudocoders, the other members should help
	the programmer directly
	
Preparation:
  - Eat a good breakfast
  - Get lots of sleep
  - Have water
  - Have the language installed and tested before the competition
  - Use a full IDE - For Python that means PyCharm, for Java that means IDEA (or NetBeans/Eclipse)
	An IDE will give you automatic code completion and other helpful things
	like syntax highlighting and it will check for errors!
  - Bring a charger for the laptop
  - Maybe bring a spare monitor
  - Ask for scratch paper before the competition! (And a pen)
  - Have FULL permissions on your computer if you can
  - Know how to use dictionaries (hashmaps in Java) and lists (arraylists/arrays in Java)
  - Bring a cheat sheet if you can
